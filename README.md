ðŸ—º - A tracker to graph my Notion contributions



**The Notion Activity Tracker is a Python-based project designed to help individuals track and visualize their activity and work progress within the popular productivity app, Notion. By leveraging the capabilities of the Notion API, this tool enables users to retrieve data from their Notion workspace, process it, and generate insightful activity charts. The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their productivity, empower them to analyze their work patterns, and facilitate goal-setting and optimization of their workflows.**

### **Key Features**

- **Data Retrieval: The Notion Activity Tracker seamlessly connects to the Notion API, allowing users to authenticate and retrieve data from their Notion workspace. It fetches information such as tasks completed, notes created, or any other relevant metrics that users wish to track.**
- **Activity Calculation: Once the data is retrieved, the Notion Activity Tracker processes it to calculate users' activity levels or work metrics. This stage involves analyzing the data, aggregating relevant information, and determining the activity count or intensity for each tracked day.**
- **Chart Generation: Leveraging the Matplotlib library, the Notion Activity Tracker generates visually appealing and informative activity charts. These charts visualize users' activity trends over time, displaying the accumulated data in an intuitive calendar-like format with color-coded boxes representing different activity levels.**
- **Visualization and Analysis: The generated activity charts empower users to visualize and analyze their productivity patterns and progress. Users can identify their most active periods, observe trends, and gain insights into their work habits. The charts serve as a valuable tool for evaluating productivity, setting goals, and making data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency.**

### **Why Use the Notion Activity Tracker?**

- **Productivity Monitoring: The Notion Activity Tracker enables users to keep track of their daily, weekly, or monthly productivity within the Notion app. By visually representing their activity levels, it helps users monitor their progress and maintain a consistent workflow.**
- **Goal Setting and Progress Tracking: With the Notion Activity Tracker, users can set productivity goals and monitor their progress over time. The activity charts provide a clear visualization of the user's activity, making it easier to assess goal attainment and adjust their efforts accordingly.**
- **Identify Peak Performance Periods: By analyzing the activity charts, users can identify their most productive periods during the day or week. This information helps users schedule their tasks and allocate time effectively, aligning their work with their peak performance hours.**
- **Workflow Optimization: The activity charts serve as a diagnostic tool, helping users identify inefficiencies or bottlenecks in their workflows. Users can pinpoint areas that require improvement or automation, leading to more streamlined and optimized work processes.**
